                                          **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster - Survival Prediction Project**             

**Project Overview**

The Titanic machine learning competition challenges Kagglers to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Being able to identify patterns in the data that linked passenger characteristics to survival would help understand this tragic event and provide insights for similar situations.

**Data**

The data contains passenger information such as name, age, sex, socio-economic class, etc. Passengers are marked as survived or did not survive. There are 891 entries with two categories for the target variable to predict. This dataset is well studied and allows comparing algorithms and feature engineering techniques.

**Analysis Steps**

The workflow will involve:

Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns in survivor characteristics
Data preprocessing like imputing missing values and encoding categories
Feature engineering including creating new variables from existing fields
Evaluating different classifiers like logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting
Tuning hyperparameters of best models using grid search
Analysing feature importance to understand driver factors of survival
Evaluating on blinded test set and submitting final predictions
